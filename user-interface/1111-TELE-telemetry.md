## Opt in to error reporting
As a wallet user, when I am using the browser extension for the first time I want to be able to decide whether to opt in to automatic error reporting or not so that I remain in full control of my privacy

- I can see an explanation of what I am being asked to opt in/out to and why (<a name="1111-TELE-001" href="#1111-TELE-001">1111-TELE-001</a>)
- I can click a link to read more details about vega user data policy (<a name="1111-TELE-002" href="#1111-TELE-002">1111-TELE-002</a>)
- I can opt in to reporting bugs and crashes (<a name="1111-TELE-003" href="#1111-TELE-003">1111-TELE-003</a>)
- I can opt out of reporting bugs and crashes (<a name="1111-TELE-004" href="#1111-TELE-004">1111-TELE-004</a>)
- If I have opted in and am using the wallet app, telemetry errors / analytics from frontend and backend are recorded / reported in Sentry (<a name="1111-TELE-005" href="#1111-TELE-005">1111-TELE-005</a>)
- If I have opted in and am using the wallet app, all keys are obscured and replaced with something appropriate in Sentry (<a name="1111-TELE-006" href="#1111-TELE-006">1111-TELE-006</a>)
- If I have opted out and am using the wallet app, telemetry errors / analytics are NOT recorded / reported in Sentry (<a name="1111-TELE-007" href="#1111-TELE-007">1111-TELE-007</a>)
- There is a way to change whether I want to opt in / out of error reporting later (e.g. in settings) (<a name="1111-TELE-008" href="#1111-TELE-008">1111-TELE-008</a>)
- If I leave the app during onboarding I am taken back to the telemetry page (<a name="1111-TELE-009" href="#1111-TELE-009">1111-TELE-009</a>)
