## Open browser wallet in new window

As a Browser Wallet User I want the browser wallet to open in a pop-up window when there is a transaction for me to approve So that I don't have to notice the dot and open the extension every time

- When the browser wallet is open in a new window, the window stays on top (<a name="1107-SETT-001" href="#1107-SETT-001">1107-SETT-001</a>)
- If I have a new window open, if there is a transaction for me to approve or reject this is shown in the new window (<a name="1107-SETT-002" href="#1107-SETT-002">1107-SETT-002</a>)
- If I approve the transaction the new window stays open (on the last view I was on) (<a name="1107-SETT-003" href="#1107-SETT-003">1107-SETT-003</a>)
- If I reject the transaction the pop-up window stays open (on the last view I was on) (<a name="1107-SETT-004" href="#1107-SETT-004">1107-SETT-004</a>)
- If I resize the new window the browser wallet still looks good (<a name="1107-SETT-005" href="#1107-SETT-005">1107-SETT-005</a>)
- If I have the new window open but then open the extension pop up I see the same thing on both views (<a name="1107-SETT-006" href="#1107-SETT-006">1107-SETT-006</a>)
- There is a way for me to open the browser wallet in a new window (<a name="1107-SETT-007" href="#1107-SETT-007">1107-SETT-007</a>)

## Wallet version number (Settings)

As a wallet user I want to understand the version # I am using So that I can trouble shoot should there be any issues

- I can see the version # of the browser extension (<a name="1107-SETT-008" href="#1107-SETT-008">1107-SETT-008</a>)
- I can see the feedback link (<a name="1107-SETT-009" href="#1107-SETT-009">1107-SETT-009</a>)
- I can see a lock button and when I press it I am logged out and redirected to the login page (<a name="1107-SETT-010" href="#1107-SETT-010">1107-SETT-010</a>)
