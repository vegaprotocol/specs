## Connect to wallet - all key(s) only

As a wallet user I want to connect my key(s) to a dapp So that I can verify transactions like orders, transfers etc.

- There is a way to approve or deny a connection request (<a name="1103-CONN-001" href="#1103-CONN-001">1103-CONN-001</a>)
- I can see a visual representation of the dapp requesting access e.g. the favicon (<a name="1103-CONN-002" href="#1103-CONN-002">1103-CONN-002</a>)
- I can see what approving a connection request enables the site / dapp to do (<a name="1103-CONN-003" href="#1103-CONN-003">1103-CONN-003</a>)
- I can see the URL of the site / dapp requesting access(<a name="1103-CONN-004" href="#1103-CONN-004">1103-CONN-004</a>)
- All new connections are for all keys in a wallet and all future keys added to the wallet(<a name="1103-CONN-005" href="#1103-CONN-005">1103-CONN-005</a>)
- There is a way to understand that i.e. this connection request gives access to ALL my keys now and in the future (<a name="1103-CONN-006" href="#1103-CONN-006">1103-CONN-006</a>)
- When I go away from the extension and come back to the connected site, the browser extension remembers the connection and does not ask me to reconnect (<a name="1103-CONN-007" href="#1103-CONN-007">1103-CONN-007</a>)
- There is a visual way to understand that a connection has been successful(<a name="1103-CONN-008" href="#1103-CONN-008">1103-CONN-008</a>)
- If the had the browser wallet open when I instigated the connection request, the browser wallet returns your view to where you were before the request came in (<a name="1103-CONN-009" href="#1103-CONN-009">1103-CONN-009</a>)
- When I try to connect to the wallet I've made during onboarding but have not "completed" onboarding, I cannot see the connection request until I've completed onboarding (it is queued in the background) (<a name="1103-CONN-010" href="#1103-CONN-010">1103-CONN-010</a>)
