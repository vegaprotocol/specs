## View network connected to

As a browser wallet user I want to know which vega network my browser wallet is connected to So that I know if I am on the network I expect to be, and whether I am transacting with real or fake assets

- The browser wallet defaults to use the Fairground network (<a name="1108-NTWK-001" href="#1108-NTWK-001">1108-NTWK-001</a>)
- I can see which vega network the browser wallet is connected to from the view wallet page(<a name="1108-NTWK-002" href="#1108-NTWK-002">1108-NTWK-002</a>)
