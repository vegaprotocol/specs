# Staking income

## Monitor staking rewards
When checking if im getting the staking return that I was expecting, I... 

- can see a when the epoch started and should finish 
- Can see the stake i have nominated to 
- see the staking income I have received for each epoch, broken down by...
  - asset
  - validator staked
  - market 
- I can see where I did not receive full income because the validator suffered penalties 
- See stake as a % of totals

...so that I can make decisions about my staking
