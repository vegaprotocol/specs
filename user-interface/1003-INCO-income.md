# Staking income

## Monitor staking rewards
When checking the staking rewards, I... 

- must be [connected to a Vega wallet](#TBD)

- **must** see when the current epoch ends
- **should** see when the current epoch started
- **should** see how much I might get at the end of the epoch
  - **should** see the balance of all infrastructure fee accounts for the current epoch
  - **should** see any real time score for the current epoch
  - **should** see if any validators have had a penalty this epoch
  
- **must** see the sum of Tokens I have nominated to each validator in the current epoch
- **should** see what percentage of my Tokens I have nominated to each validator in the current epoch
- **must** see the staking income I have received for each epoch
  - **must** see asset name
  - **must** see balance of asset
  - **must** see type (organic or treasury)
- **should** see the staking income by epoch, broken down by validator
- **should** see the staking income by epoch, broken down by market

- **should** see all income values expressed in a single currency
  
- **must** see where I can see where I did not receive full income because the validator suffered penalties 

...so that I can make decisions about my staking
