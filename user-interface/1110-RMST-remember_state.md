## Coming back to the app after onboarding

As a user I want to see my wallet / keys immediately when I open my extension (and not onboarding again) So that I don't need to repeat onboarding unnecessarily and continue my task easily...

- There is a way to determine if user has onboarded (<a name="1110-RMST-001" href="#1110-RMST-001">1110-RMST-001</a>)
- I want to see the previous page I was on or my wallet page by default (<a name="1110-RMST-002" href="#1110-RMST-002">1110-RMST-002</a>)

## Remember where I am in the onboarding flow

As a browser wallet user When I have started onboarding in the browser wallet and I close the extension / browser I want to be able to reopen the extension and it remember where I was in the onboarding flow So that I don't have to start again

- I can close the extension and when I reopen it it opens on the same page / view (<a name="1110-RMST-003" href="#1110-RMST-003">1110-RMST-003</a>)
