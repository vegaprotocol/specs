## View connections

As a wallet user I want to see which dapps have permission to access my keys So that I can understand who/what has access to my keys

- I can see which dapps have permission to access my keys (<a name="1109-VCON-001" href="#1109-VCON-001">1109-VCON-001</a>)
- I can see an explanation of what it means i.e. these dapps have permission to access my keys and connect to my wallet (<a name="1109-VCON-002" href="#1109-VCON-002">1109-VCON-002</a>)
- I can see instructions how to connect to a Vega dapp (<a name="1109-VCON-003" href="#1109-VCON-003">1109-VCON-003</a>)
- There is a way to see the dapps I could connect with (e.g. a link to https://vega.xyz/use ) (<a name="1109-VCON-004" href="#1109-VCON-004">1109-VCON-004</a>)
- When I have no connections I can see that and still see instructions on how to connect to a Vega dapp (<a name="1109-VCON-005" href="#1109-VCON-005">1109-VCON-005</a>)
- I can choose to disconnect a dapp connection (and it's pre-approved status i.e. the next time I want to connect the dapp I am asked to approve the connection) (<a name="1109-VCON-006" href="#1109-VCON-006">1109-VCON-006</a>)
- The dapp is informed of the disconnection via an event handler (<a name="1109-VCON-007" href="#1109-VCON-007">1109-VCON-007</a>)
- If I have the extension open on the Connections view AND I approve a request to connect to a dapp (and the connection is successful), the connections view should update to show the new connection (<a name="1109-VCON-008" href="#1109-VCON-008">1109-VCON-008</a>)
