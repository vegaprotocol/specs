# Vesting
Some governance tokens may be held by a Vesting contract. This means that can be "owned" by an Ethereum key but not freely transferred until a vesting terms are complete.

## list of tranches

## details of a tranche 

## see summary for a given Ethereum key

## redeem tokens from a tranche
Note: it is not possible to choose how many tokens you redeem from a tranche, instead you select a tranche and the smart contract will attempt to redeem all. However, it will fail if some of the amount it attempts to redeem have been associated to a Vega key. Therefore the job of this page is to help the user work out how many tokens to disassociate before they can successfully redeem.
