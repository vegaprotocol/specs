# Browser Wallet

## Configure network

As a browser wallet user I want to create a password for my browser wallet app So that I can secure my wallets and keys on this device

- When I haven't submitted my password, I can go back to the previous step (<a name="100001-BWAL-001" href="#100001-BWAL-001">100001-BWAL-001</a>)
- I can see an explanation of what the password is for and that it cannot be used to recover my keys or recover itself (<a name="100001-BWAL-002" href="#100001-BWAL-002">100001-BWAL-002</a>)
- I can enter a password for the browser wallet (<a name="100001-BWAL-003" href="#100001-BWAL-003">100001-BWAL-003</a>)
- I can verify the password I set for my browser wallet (to help ensure I typed it correctly and can replicate it) (<a name="100001-BWAL-004" href="#100001-BWAL-004">100001-BWAL-004</a>)
- I can verify that I understand that Vega doesn't store and therefore can't recover this password if I lose it (<a name="100001-BWAL-005" href="#100001-BWAL-005">100001-BWAL-005</a>)
- I can NOT submit an empty password (<a name="100001-BWAL-006" href="#100001-BWAL-006">100001-BWAL-006</a>)
- I can submit the password I entered (<a name="100001-BWAL-007" href="#100001-BWAL-007">100001-BWAL-007</a>)
- When I have submitted my new password, I am given some feedback that it was set successfully (<a name="100001-BWAL-008" href="#100001-BWAL-008">100001-BWAL-008</a>)
- When I have submitted my new password, I am taken to the next step (<a name="100001-BWAL-009" href="#100001-BWAL-009">100001-BWAL-009</a>)
- When I have submitted my new password, I can NOT go back to the previous step (<a name="100001-BWAL-010" href="#100001-BWAL-010">100001-BWAL-010</a>)

## Create or import wallet

As a browser wallet user I want to decide whether to create a new wallet or import an existing one So that I understand my options and don't waste time creating a new wallet when I already created one elsewhere

- I can choose to create a wallet (<a name="100001-BWAL-011" href="#100001-BWAL-011">100001-BWAL-011</a>)
- I can choose to import an existing wallet (<a name="100001-BWAL-012" href="#100001-BWAL-012">100001-BWAL-012</a>)

## Confirm recovery phrase

As a wallet user I want to validate I have "recorded" or saved the recovery phrase accurately So that I feel secure and confident to go ahead

- I can confirm I have written down / saved my recovery phrase by entering parts of it again in the UI(<a name="100001-BWAL-013" href="#100001-BWAL-013">100001-BWAL-013</a>)
- There is a way to go back to see the full recovery phrase if I have written / saved it incorrectly (<a name="100001-BWAL-014" href="#100001-BWAL-014">100001-BWAL-014</a>)
- I can click to continue to the next step of onboarding once I've successfully entered the relevant parts of the phrase (<a name="100001-BWAL-015" href="#100001-BWAL-015">100001-BWAL-015</a>)
- There is a way to understand if the details I've entered are incorrect e.g. highlight in red (<a name="100001-BWAL-016" href="#100001-BWAL-016">100001-BWAL-016</a>)
