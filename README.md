## What this process is
1. Create a new branch
1. Copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-feature.md` (where 'my feature' is descriptive. Don't assign an RFC number yet).
1. Fill in the details. Please take care with the details.
1. Submit a pull request to start soliciting feedback. Ensure that the appropriate team members are notified.
1. Build consensus and integrate feedback.

## The RFC lifecycle
When a specification is merged, it is ready for development.

Any changes to the specification should be done in merge requests.

## Reviewing RFCs
When a pull request is open,

## Implementing a specification
When a specification is merged, it is ready for development. The relevant team can then break the specification down in to technical tasks in their own task system.

Issues may be created in the Product issue list to define a particular scope for an upcoming release. This can be used to limit the scope of work for technical tasking in the case that an MVP or spike is required. The specification should be as complete as it can be, while the issue may be a smaller piece on the way to implementing the first specification.

# Notes
The workflow and for this is largely based on the Rust RFC process: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs

It is being adopted as a replacement for using Gitlab issues, which is where past product specifications have beeen written up.
