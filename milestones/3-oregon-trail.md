# Oregon Trail

* **Overview**: ü§† Feature readiness for trading on mainnet.
* **Result**: A new network named Wild Westnet will be launched based on this milestone, which will point at Ethereum mainnet and be run with Validators none of which are controlled by the Vega team.
* **Milestone Tag** "ü§† Oregon Trail"
* **Target timings**: 6-8 weeks?? (late Feb to coinside with Eth Denver??)
