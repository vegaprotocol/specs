# Sweetwater

* **Status**: Being confirmed
* **Overview**: Really minimal mainnet that allows us to test validators running a minimal Vega network. This is a new network: Mainnet. There is no trading.
* **Result**: Part way through Oregon Trail, a network that can run, connected to Ethereum mainnet, with minimal features
* **Project board**: -

|:---------:|---------|---------|:------:| :------:|  :------:|
|  **1** | Settlement at Expiry |  We don’t want a network that can’t settle. No oracle bot will exist. | [Specced](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/blob/master/protocol/0002-settlement.md)  |  ?  | @gordsport / @barnabee  |

| **4** | [💀 Limited Network Life](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/70)  | This network will definitely be restarted. Some state needs to survive that restart. However we don’t checkpoint at bundles. Delegation needs to be specced.. |  ? |  0  | @davidsiska-vega |
