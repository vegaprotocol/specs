# Sweetwater

* **Status**: Scope confirmed
* **Overview**: Really minimal mainnet that allows us to test validators running a minimal Vega network. This is a new network: Mainnet. There is no trading.
* **Result**: Part way through Oregon Trail, a network that can run, connected to Ethereum mainnet, with minimal features
* **Project board**: [💧 Sweetwater](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/79)
* **Open Source**: 🤷‍♂️
* **Date**: Must be a live network on 3rd September 2021

## Core
The following features are required for this network to be what we need.

### Features
| Priority | Feature | Because | Specs/Scope | Owner |
|:---------:|---------|---------|---------|:------:|
|  **1** | [⚖ Settlement at Expiry](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/5) |  We don’t want a network that can’t settle. No oracle bot will exist. | [Settlement at instrument expiry](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/blob/master/protocol/0002-settlement.md#settlement-at-instrument-expiry) | @barnabee  |
|  **2**  | [🧛‍♀️&nbsp;Staking bridge](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/80) | Token holders with locked tokens want to stake. Governance must be updated to look at the staking account instead of the general account | [Staking Bridge](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/blob/master/non-protocol-specs/0004-staking-bridge.md) | @barnabee |
| **3** |  [🐕 Validators](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/65)    | We will not be running any nodes      | <ul><li>**Token Staking and Delegation (inc. New Network Params)**</li><li>[Governance Weigthing](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/blob/master/protocol/0028-governance.md#governance-weighting)</li><li>[Simple POS Rewards](protocol/0000-simple-POS-rewards.md)</li><li>[Simple Staking and Delegation](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/pull/582/files#diff-fb50f61f3a8de64c5c167aae4017c398c23e9b8d21866b55dd6d37ba6a615de1)</li><li>**Basics Performace Measure**</li><li>In-Scope TBC</li><li>**Fixed Validator set in Genesis**</li><li>Getting Genesis Block to Validators</li><li>Fixed validator spec</li></ul>   | Meeting on Monday 14th |
| **4** | [APIs that describe delegation, stakes and validators, and allow delegation](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/65) | They aren’t done | TBC | @edd |
| **5** | [💀 Limited Network Life](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/70)  | This network will definitely be restarted. Some state needs to survive that restart. However we don’t checkpoint at bundles. Delegation needs to be specced.. | [Limited Network Life](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/blob/master/non-protocol-specs/0003-limited-network-life.md) | @davidsiska-vega |
| **6** | [👑 On-Chain Treasury](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/81) | There needs to be a pool of assets to reward people | []() | @tamlyn10  |
| **7**  | [🥉Rewards from treasury](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/81) | The current spec defines some rewards based on trading. We will have no trading. | <ul><li>**Rewards from Treasury**</li><ul><li>[S.1 - Rewarding getting started with delegation](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/blob/f102c0a00e106bd7e78b5f3224feba932b07bd9e/protocol/0000-reward-functions.md#s1---rewarding-getting-started-with-delegation)</li>[S.2 - Rewarding consistent delegation](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/blob/f102c0a00e106bd7e78b5f3224feba932b07bd9e/protocol/0000-reward-functions.md#s2---rewarding-consistent-delegation)<li></ul></ul> | @tamlyn10  |
| **8** |  [👮‍♂️ Testnet Limits](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/44) | Depositing via the bridge will not be possible| [Training Wheels](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/blob/6290a9caac050fa63e2f6de0709e6a21f5cd9290/non-protocol-specs/0002-training-wheels.md) | @barnabee   |
| **9** |  [📧 Spam protection](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/82) | Reduce attack vectors | [Spam Protection](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs-internal/pull/579/files) | @Vegaklaus |
|  **10**  | [A voted-on genesis block](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/issues/3648) | Token holders will have voted for it | [Configure Genesis Block](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/issues/3648) | @edd  

### Refactors
| Feature | Because | Status |
|---------|---------|:------:|
| [uint shift](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/issues/3005) |  It’s in progress and will hold up future iteration. Let’s take the hit now  | In development  |
| [API Split](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/56) | The nodes running in 💧 should represent the nodes running in 🤠 |  Ready for development |
