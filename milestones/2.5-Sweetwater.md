# Sweetwater

* **Status**: Being confirmed
* **Overview**: Really minimal mainnet that allows us to test validators running a minimal Vega network. This is a new network: Mainnet. There is no trading.
* **Result**: Part way through Oregon Trail, a network that can run, connected to Ethereum mainnet, with minimal features
* **Project board**: -

### Features
| Priority | Feature | Because | Owner |
|:---------:|---------|---------|:------:|
|  **1** | Settlement at Expiry |  We don’t want a network that can’t settle. No oracle bot will exist. | @barnabee  |
|  **2**  | 🧛‍♀️&nbsp;Staking bridge | Token holders with locked tokens want to stake. Governance must be updated to look at the staking account instead of the general account | @barnabee |
| **3** |  [🐕 Validators](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/65)    | We will not be running any nodes         | Meeting on Monday 14th |
| **4** | [💀 Limited Network Life](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/70)  | This network will definitely be restarted. Some state needs to survive that restart. However we don’t checkpoint at bundles. Delegation needs to be specced.. | @davidsiska-vega |
| **5** | 👑 On-Chain Treasury | There needs to be a pool of assets to reward people | @tamlyn10  |
| **6**  | 🥉Rewards from treasury | The current spec defines some rewards based on trading. We will have no trading. | @tamlyn10  |
| **7** |  [👮‍♂️ Testnet Limits](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/44) | Depositing via the bridge will not be possible|  @barnabee   |
| **8** |  Spam protection | Reduce attack vectors | @Vegaklaus |
|  **9**  | APIs that describe delegation, stakes and validators, and allow delegation | They aren’t done | @edd |
|  **10**  | A voted-on genesis block | Token holders will have voted for it | @edd  

### Refactors
| Feature | Because | Status |
|---------|---------|:------:|
| uint shift |  It’s in progress and will hold up future iteration. Let’s take the hit now  | In development  |
| API Split | The nodes running in 💧 should represent the nodes running in 🤠 |  Ready for development |
