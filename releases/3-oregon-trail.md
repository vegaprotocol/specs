# Oregon Trail

* **Status**: Being confirmed
* **Overview**: ü§† Feature readiness for mainnet 1Ô∏è‚É£.
* **Result**: A new network named Wild Westnet will be launched based on this release, which will point at Ethereum mainnet and be run with Validators none of which are controlled by the Vega team.
* **Project board**: https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/58

## Core

### Features
- [Data Sourcing](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/19) - [[SPEC-0045](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/product/blob/master/specs/0045-data-sourcing.md)]
  - Signed message data source (OpenOracle/ABI encoded, Protobuf key value?)
  - Time based trigger
  - Simple filters (<=>)
- [Settlement at expiry](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/5) - [[SPEC-0016](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/product/blob/master/specs/0016-product-builtin-future.md#42-final-settlement-expiry)]
- [Fractional order and position sizes](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/69) (Needs a spec)
  - Orders and positions can be fractional with a configurable by market number of decimal places
  - Validate order sizes are a non-zero multiple of the smallest increment (i.e. )
  - Positions and margin work correctly with fractional orders
  - For engineeering: can be implemented with a decimal data type or uint[256?] same as for amounts
- [Limited network life](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/70) (No spec written)
  - How to finally settle/unwind/do withdrawals after the end
  - Migrating balances between network runs 
- [Validators](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/65) (No spec written, _[Research Paper](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/research-internal/blob/master/validator_rewards/ValPol.pdf)_)
  - Stake delegation
  - Validator rewards (and delegator rewards)
  - Vega interacting with the Tendermint validator power
  - Quality of Life improvements for node runners (_[VIP-1](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/VIPs/pull/1))_
- [On-chain rewards](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/research-internal/issues/197) (Research Task, no spec written)
  - Trade mining
  - Liquidity mining
  - Validator mining?
 - Expanded spam protection

### Refactors
- [API server split out from the core](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/56)
- ...

### [Limits / Training wheels](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/44) (refine after January workshop)
 - Max (lifetime) deposit or maximum balance per party (including margin). This may be different for liquidity providers.
 - Withdrawal waiting period
 - Governance to interrupt withdrawal

## Block Explorer
- Open source block explorer
  - Backed by a database

1Ô∏è‚É£ This doesn't mean mainnet happens immediately at the end of this release, just that the features we need for it exist. This means that no real tokens will be used before this release, but that a network *could* be launched that *would* use real, value having tokens.
