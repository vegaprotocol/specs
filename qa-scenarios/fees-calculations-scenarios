Feature - Fees Calculations

# Test Scenarios -

Scenario : Fees Calculations 
Given I have open orders on my account
When the order gets matched resulting in one or multple trades 
Then each fee is correctly calculated in settlement currency of the market as below -
  infrastructure_fee = fee_factor[infrastructure] * trade_value_for_fee_purposes
  maker_fee =  fee_factor[maker]  * trade_value_for_fee_purposes
  liquidity_fee = fee_factor[liquidity] * trade_value_for_fee_purposes
  total_fee = infrastructure_fee + maker_fee + liquidity_fee

Scenario : General Account Balance during cont. & auction sessions
Given the orders are matched and trades get created
When each of 3 fees are calculated for the trade 
Then the money is collected from general account

Scenario : Insuffcient General Account Balance during cont. & auction sessions
Given the orders are matched and trades get created
When each of 3 fees are calculated for the trade
And general account balance is insufficient to cover full / part of all 3 fees or total_fee
Then the money is collected from Margin account

Scenario : Insuffcient General and & Margin Account Balance
Given the orders are matched and trades get created
When each of 3 fees are calculated for the trade
And general & margin account balance is insufficient to cover full / part of all 3 fees or total_fee
Then different rules apply between continuous trading and auctions - TBC
During cont. session -
During Normal auction sessions - The fee is distributed so that the infrastructure_fee is paid first and only then the liquidity_fee

Scenario : No maker,taker relationship between the trading parties in Auction (No Proce maker)
Given the markets are in Normal Auctions (including market protection and opening auctions) 
When the orders are matched and trades get created
Then for the trade
  maker_fee = 0
  infrastructure_fee and liquidity_fee = Spilt 1/2 between both parties / takers
