# Accounts

## Accounts controlled by parties
A party only has control over balances in the "general" account for each asset. 
[Parties](./0017-PART-party.md) are identified by Vega public keys. Each party that makes a deposit on one of the asset bridges, currently only [Ethereum ERC20 bridge](./0031-ETHB-ethereum_bridge_spec.md) will have a general account for the relevant [asset](./0040-ASSF-asset_framework.md) created. 
In order to submit [orders](./0014-ORDT-order_types.md a non-zero general account balance is needed; Vega will transfer appropriate amount to the [margin account](./0011-MARA-check_order_allocate_margin.md) for the party and the market.  

Any party can submit a withdrawal transaction to withdraw assets from the general account to a specified address on another chain, currently only [Ethereum ERC20 bridge](./0031-ETHB-ethereum_bridge_spec.md). 

Any party can set up a transfer from their general account to other Vega accounts as described by the [transfer spec](./0057-TRAN-transfers.md).

Note that a party can also associate the governance / staking asset via the [Vega staking bridge contract](../non-protocol-specs/0006-NP-STAK-erc20_governance_token_staking.md) but this number is *not* an account balance because it *cannot* be used as [collateral](./0005-COLL-collateral.md) for trading and it cannot be transferred. 

##Â Accounts controlled by Vega

1. Mark-to-market settlement account per market: this is used for collecting and distributing mark-to-market settlement cashflows and is *zero* at the end of each mark-to-market settlement run.
1. Margin accounts for each party with open orders or positions on any [market](./0043-MKTL-market_lifecycle.md).
1. Bond account for any party that's an [LP on any market](0038-OLIQ-liquidity_provision_order_type.md). 
1. [Insurance pool account](0015-INSR-market_insurance_pool_collateral.md) for any market. 
1. [Liquidity fee pool](0042-LIQF-setting_fees_and_rewarding_lps.md) for any market. 
1. [Infrastructure fee pool](0029-FEES-fees.md) for any asset. 
1. [Reward accounts](0056-REWA-rewards_overview.md) which exist for *each* reward account per every Vega asset (settlement asset) and per every reward metric per every Vega asset (reward asset). There is an additional [staking rewards](0061-REWP-pos_rewards.md) account. 
1. [Vega trasury accounts](0055-TREA-on_chain_treasury.md) per Vega asset. 

One key difference with staking accounts is that the collateral is not held in an asset bridge, but in the [staking bridge](./0071-STAK-erc20_governance_token_staking.md). The balance is changed by events on Ethereum, rather than actions taken on the Vega chain.

# Summary

Accounts are used on Vega to maintain a record of the amount of collateral that is deposited and deployed by participants in the market.


# Reference-level explanation

Various actions that occur in the protocol will prompt the creation and/or deletion of accounts. Double entry accounting is maintained at all points.

All accounts must:

- have an initial value of zero for whichever asset it maintains
- only change balance as a response to a valid transfer request that adheres to double entry accounting standards.
- only be created and deleted by transfer requests. Deletion account transfer requests must specify which account should receive any outstanding funds in the account that's being deleted.

## Accounts for assets

**Creation/Deletion:**

The first time an entity deposits an asset into Vega's collateral smart contract, an asset account is created for that party on Vega and credited with the equivalent amount. 

This account:

* is where the trading profits for all markets that have settlement in that asset will be eventually distributed back to (this occurs when the protocol releases collateral from a margin account)
* is where the protocol searches for collateral if the trader has entered a collateral search zone. 
* is used by all Vega markets with that settlement asset.
* will have it's balance increased or decreased when a party deposits or withdraws that asset from Vega.

The core protocol does not require these general asset accounts if they have a balance of zero.

## Margin accounts

Margin accounts are used by the protocol to maintain [margin requirements](./0010-MARG-margin_orchestration.md) and collect and distribute [mark to market settlement](./0003-MTMK-mark_to_market_settlement.md). Each party only needs a margin account created for a market they've ever put an order on.

Moreover, margin accounts are conceptually connected to open positions and given there no such thing as a zero open position a margin account may therefore be transient (i.e. there would be no such thing as a margin account that has a balance of zero).


**Creation/Deletion:**

When a trader places an order on a market and they do not have a margin account for that market, a margin accounts is created for the trader for each settlement asset of that market. This may be due to either:
* it's the first time a trader has placed an order or;
* they've previously had a margin account but it was deleted for the reason listed below.

When a trader no longer has collateral requirements for a  market (because they don't have open positions or active orders), these accounts no longer have utility in the core protocol and may be deleted. Accounts may also be deleted for other reasons (e.g. a system account at the conclusion of a set of [closeouts](./0012-POSR-position_resolution.md)).

If there is a positive balance in an account that is being deleted, that balance should be transferred to the account specified in the transfer request (which for margin accounts will typically be the insurance pool of the market).


## Bond accounts
Bond accounts are opened when a party opens a [Liquidity Provision order](./0038-OLIQ-liquidity_provision_order_type.md). The bond is held by the network to ensure that the Liquidity PRovider maintains enough collateral to cover their commitment. [0044-LIME - LP Mechanics](./0044-LIME-lp_mechanics.md) contains more detail on bond management. 

## Insurance pools

Every market will have at least one insurance pool account that holds collateral that can be used to cover losses in case of unreasonable market events.

**Creation/Deletion:**

When a [market launches](./0043-MKTL_market_livecycle.md), an insurance pool account is created for that market for each settlement asset. This account is used by the protocol during the collection of [margin requirements](./0010-MARG-margin_orchestration.md) and the collection of [mark to market settlement](./0003-MTMK-mark_to_market_settlement.md). 

When a market is finalised / closed remaining funds are distributed to the on chain treasury.  This occurs using ledger entries to preserve double entry accounting records within the collateral engine.

# Staking accounts
In Vega governance is controlled by a [governance token](./0029-GOVE-governance.md#governance-asset) which is [nominated and staked](./0059-STKG-simple_staking_and_governance.md), and is held in a smart contract on Ethereum. As the assets are held off-chain, a party's staking balance is treated differently to the account types above.

- Like [margin accounts](#margin-accounts), a party cannot transfer or place orders with the balance in staking accounts

Note that it *is* possible to have markets in the governance asset, in which case all of the accounts detailed above will still apply. Staking accounts only relate to the balance of the governance asset that has been staked.

# Acceptance Criteria
## All ordinary accounts

(<a name="0013-ACCT-022" href="#0013-ACCT-022">0013-ACCT-022</a>)

## Special case: Staking accounts
One key difference with staking accounts is that the collateral is not held in an asset bridge, but in the [staking bridge](../non-protocol-specs/0006-NP-STAK-erc20_governance_token_staking.md). The balance is changed by events on Ethereum, rather than actions taken on the Vega chain. For more information on staking and stake delegation see [Simple staking and delegation](./0050-STKG-simple_staking_and_delegating.md).

## Party staking accounts

  - [ ] Multiple stake linkings can exist per party per asset. (<a name="0013-ACCT-014" href="#0013-ACCT-014">0013-ACCT-014</a>)
  - [ ] The balance can only be delegated to Validators (<a name="0013-ACCT-015" href="#0013-ACCT-015">0013-ACCT-015</a>)
  - [ ] The balance cannot be traded, or used as margin, or transferred, or withdrawn (<a name="0013-ACCT-016" href="#0013-ACCT-016">0013-ACCT-016</a>)
  - [ ] Delegated stake remains in the trader's staking account (<a name="0013-ACCT-017" href="#0013-ACCT-017">0013-ACCT-017</a>)
