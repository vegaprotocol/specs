Feature name: market-data

# Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] If there are no buy orders on the order book, the best bid price is empty / nothing.
- [ ] If there are no sell orders on the order book, the best offer price is empty / nothing.
- [ ] If there are multiple buy orders on the order book with a price equal to the best bid price, the best bid volume equals the sum of the sizes of these orders.
- [ ] If there are multiple sell orders on the order book with a price equal to the best bid price, the best offer volume equals the sum of the sizes of these orders.
- [ ] The mid price is empty / nothing if there is either no buy order or no sell orders.
- [ ] The mid price is the arithmetic average of the best bid price and best offer price.
- [ ] The mark price calculation uses the methodology specified in the market framework.
- [ ] The Open interest returns the sum of the size for all open positions where positions size is greater than 0.
- [ ] The Open interest returns 0 if there are no positions on the market
- [ ] Pegged orders are excluded from the best price and volume calculations.
- [ ] Dynamic orders should be ignored when calculating the static values

# Summary
This data is a snapshot of the state of the market at a point in time.

# Guide-level explanation
Due to supporting dynamic orders such as pegged orders the main market data fields are split up into two parts. Normal values and static values. Normal values for **Mid price**, **Best bid price** and **Best offer price** take into account all orders on the book (both normal and dynamic). Static values are calculated using only non-dynamic orders and so will not count any pegged orders in the calculation.

# Reference-level explanation

## Market data

### Continuous trading (order book)

All these values can be empty/nothing if there is insufficient relevant data.

  - **Best bid price:** the highest price level on an order book for persistent, non pegged buy orders.
  - **Best bid volume:** the aggregated volume being bid at the _best bid price_ excluding pegged orders.
  - **Best offer price:** the lowest price level on an order book for persistent, non pegged offer orders.
  - **Best offer volume:** the aggregated volume being offered at the _best offer price_ excluding pegged orders.
  - **Mid price:** the arithmetic average of the _best bid price_ and _best offer price_.
  - **Mark price:** the current mark price as calculated by the selected mark price methodology.
  - **Open interest:** the sum of the size of all positions greater than 0.
  - **Best static bid price:** the highest price level on the order book for non-dynamic buy orders.
  - **Best static offer price:** the lowest price level on an order book for non-dynamic offer orders.
  - **Static mid price:** the arithmetic average of the _best static bid price_ and _best static offer price_.
