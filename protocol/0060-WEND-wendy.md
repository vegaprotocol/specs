# Implementation
The implementation will be the last protocol described in the paper (Post-Processing-Wendy)
Clarification: If market_id = 0, a transaction isn't touched by Wendy but passed through
Transactions need to be submitted to all validators by the client.

To specify:
  - C&R Integration
  - Tersting with a network simulator
