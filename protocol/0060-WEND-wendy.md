## Implementation

The implementation will be the last protocol described in the paper (Post-Processing-Wendy)
Clarification: If `market_id` = 0, a transaction isn't touched by Wendy but passed through
Transactions need to be submitted to all validators by the client.

- Testing with a network simulator
