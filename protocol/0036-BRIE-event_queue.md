Feature name: Event Queue

# Summary
Latency and throughput is of paramount importance to Vega validator nodes, so monitoring various 3rd party (and notably low transaction speed) blockchains and crypto-assets isnâ€™t possible.
To counter this problem we have created an event queue management system.
This event queue allows the standardisation and propagation of transactions from 3rd party asset chains in the Vega event message format.

# Guide-level explanation
Events and transactions are gathered and processed by the Event Queue from a given 3rd party blockchain, and only the ones subscribed to by Vega nodes will be propagated through consensus and then validated by the validator nodes.
The Event Queue continually scans local or hosted external blockchain nodes to discover on-chain events that are applicable to Vega.
Found external blockchain events are then sent to Vega validator nodes.
This makes the event queue works as a buffer between the slow/complicated world of various blockchains, and the high throughput, low latency of Vega Core.
This message queue will use gRPC to communicate with the Vega network via 3 main functions:
1. `GetSubscribedEventSources` returns a list of smart contract addresses and events that consensus has deemed as a valid source.
1. `PropagateChainEvent` allows an event queue to send events raised on 3rd party blockchains (deposits, withdrawals, etc) through Vega consensus to ensure an event has been seen by the network. This function must support multiple blockchains as sources of events and multiple sources on a single blockchain (such as multiple deployments of an ERC20 bridge).

   Each validator will individually process and validate the given transaction and process the specified event reported using their local chain node (such as Ethereum).
1. `GetEventAcceptanceStatus` returns the consensus acceptance status of a requested event. The event queue uses this function to determine if it should attempt to send the event again.

# Reference-level explanation
* The event queue calls `GetSubscribedEventSources` on a Vega node to get the list of subscribed smart contracts
* Using configured external blockchain nodes, the Event Queue filters for specific events provided in `GetSubscribedEventSourcesResponse`
* For each event it calls `GetEventAcceptanceStatus` on a Vega node
* Event Queue then creates an `PropagateChainEventRequest` for each applicable event that has yet to be accepted and submits them to `PropagateChainEvent` on a Vega validator node
* Vega validators each verify each event against local external blockchain nodes as the event is gossiped
* Consensus agrees and writes event into the Vega chain

# Pseudo-code / Examples

    event Asset_Withdrawn(address indexed user_address, address indexed asset_source, uint256 amount, uint256 nonce);
    event Asset_Deposited(
        address indexed user_address,
        address indexed asset_source,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes32 vega_public_key
    );
    event Asset_Listed(address indexed asset_source, bytes32 indexed vega_asset_id, uint256 nonce);
    event Asset_Removed(address indexed asset_source, uint256 nonce);
    event Asset_Limits_Updated(address indexed asset_source, uint256 lifetime_limit, uint256 withdraw_threshold);
