A standard party may have:
- 0 or more [accounts](./0013-ACCT-accounts.md). These accounts may contain a balance of a single [asset](./0040-ASSF-asset_framework.md). This is known as [collateral](./0005-COLL-collateral.md)
- positions on 0 or more [markets](./0001-MKTF-market_framework.md)
- orders on 0 or more [markets](./0001-MKTF-market_framework.md)
- 0 or more governance proposals submitted,see [governance](./0028-GOVE-governance.md)

A standard party can:
- [Submit an order](./0025-OCRE-order_submission.md)
- [Amend an order](./0004-AMND-amends.md)
- [Cancel an order](./0033-OCAN-cancel_orders.md)
- [Submit a governance proposal](./0028-GOVE-governance.md)
- [Vote on a governance proposal](./0028-GOVE-governance.md)

# Guide-level explanation
## Standard party
A standard party is any that is controlled via transactions signed by an [ed25519 keypair](./0067-KEYS-key_management.md). Throughout the specifications, if the term 'party' is used without qualification, it probably means a standard party.

## Special parties
There is currently one 'special' party in Vega. They are controlled by the Vega core, and no entity should be able to perform an action as a special party other than the core. Transactions cannot be submitted via the blockchain as any special party, and there is no keypair specifically associated with a special party.

### 'network' party
The `network` party is a pseudoparty. It is used in [position resolution](./0012-POSR-position_resolution.md) to close distressed [positions](./0006-POSI-positions_core.md) or [orders](./0024-OSTA-order_status.md). See [Order Types: Network Orders](./0014-ORDT-order_types.md#network-orders) for more detail on how these orders are used.
