# Validator Tendermint Weights

Vega is running a delegated proof of stake blockchain based on Tendermint. 

For each validator node Tendermint keeps the "weight" of the node for consensus purposes. This spec clarifies how such weight is calculated on Vega. 

On Vega the voting power is calcualted as follows: `stakeScore x performanceScore` normalised by the sum of those scores. Where `stakeScore` is defined as the anti-whaling stake score of tendermint validators and performance score is the proportion of successful proposals of the validator normalised to their voting power. 

The weights should be updated every epoch.

The minimum voting power for a non-empty network is 1 (0 implies that the validator is removed from the network).

If the network has no stake at all, then all validators would have equal voting power of 10.
