# Limited network life.

Vega networks will at least initially and perhaps always run for a limited time only. This spec covers the necessary features to ensure this works smoothly.

# Background

Networks will have a finite lifetime because:

- It is efficient to upgrade the protocol by starting again as it avoids the need to deal with multiple versions of the code (upgrades to a running chain need to respect and be able to recalculate the pre-upgrade deterministic state for earlier blocks, so all versions of criticial code must remain in the system). 
This is especially important early on when rapid iteration is desirable, as the assumption that new chains can be started for new features simplifies things considerably.

- Trading at 1000s of tx/sec generates a lot of data. Given that most instruments are non-perpetual (they expire), this gives the ability to create new markets on a new chain and naturally let the old one come to an end rather than dragging around its history forever.

- Bugs, security breaches, or other issues during alpha could either take out the chain OR make it desirable to halt block production. It's important to consider what happens next if this occurs.

# Overview
There are really two main features:
1. Create checkpoints with relevant (but minimal) information at regular intervals, and on every deposit and every withdrawal request.
2. Ability to load a checkpoint file as part of genesis. 

Point two requires that at load time, each node calculates the hash of the checkpoint file. It then sends this through consensus to make sure that all the nodes in the new network are agreeing on the state.

# Creating a checkpoint
Information to store:
- All [network parameters](../protocol/0054-network-parameters.md)
- Including those defined [below](#network-parameters).
- All [asset definitions](../protocol/0040-asset-framework.md#asset-definition). Insurance pool balance from the markets will be summed up per asset and balance per asset stored. 
- All market proposals ([creation](../protocol/0028-governance.md#1-create-market) and [update](../protocol/0028-governance.md#2-change-market-parameters)) that have been *accepted*. 
- All [asset proposals](../protocol/0028-governance.md) that have been *accepted*.
- All delegation info.
- On chain treasury balances and on-chain reward functions / parameters (for ðŸ’§ Sweetwater this is only the network params that govern [Staking and delegation](0000-reward-functions.md) ).
- [Account balances](../protocol/0013-accounts.md) for all parties per asset: sum of general, margin and LP bond accounts. See exception below. 
- Withdrawal transaction bundles for all bridged chains for all ongoing withdrawals (parties with non-zero "signed-for-withdrawal" balances)
- hash of the previous block, block number and transaction id of the block from which the snapshot is derived
When a checkpoint is created, each validator should calculate its hash and submit this as a transaction to the chain(*). 
- last block height and hash and event ID of all bridged chains (e.g. Ethereum) that the core has seen `number_of_confirmations` of the event. 

When to create a checkpoint:
- if `current_time - time_elapsed_between_checkpoints > time_of_last_full_checkpoint`
- if there was withdrawal 
Withdrawal checkpoint can be just a delta containing the balance change + hash of previous checkpoint (either delta or full). 

Information we explicitly don't try to checkpoint:
- Positions, limit orders, pegged orders or any order book data. 
- Balances in the "signed for withdrawal" account. 
- Market and asset proposals where the voting period hasn't ended. 

When a checkpoint is created, each validator should calculate its hash and submit this is a transaction to the chain(*). 
(*) This is so that non-validating parties can trust the hash being restored represents truly the balances. 

The checkpoint file should either be human-readable OR there should be a command line tool to convert into human readable form. 

# Restoring a checkpoint
The hash of the state file to be restored must be specified in genesis. 
Any validator will submit a transaction containing the checkpoint file. Nodes verify the hash / chain of hashes to verify the hash that is in genesis.
- If the hash matches, it will be restored.
- If it does not, the hash transaction will have no effect.

If the genesis file has a previous state hash no transactions will be processed until the restore transaction arrives and is processed. 

The state will be restored in this order:

1. Restore network parameters. 
2. Load the asset definitions. 
    1. The network will compare the asset coming from the restore file with the genesis assets, one by one. If there is an exact match on asset id:
      -  either the rest of the asset definition matches exactly in which case move to next asset coming from restore file. 
      -  or any of the part of the definition differ, in which case ignore the restore transaction. 
    2. If the asset coming from the restore file is a new asset (asset id not matching any genesis assets) then ignore the restore transaction.
4. Load the accepted market proposals.
    - If the enactment date is in the past then set the enactment date to `now + net_param_min_enact` (so that opening auction can take place) and status to pending. 
    - In case `now + net_param_min_enact >= trading_terminated` set the status to cancelled. 
5. Replay events from bridged chains from the last event id stored in the checkpoint.

There should be a tool to extract all assets from the restore file so that they can be added to genesis block manually, should the validators so desire.

# Taking limited network life into account 
- Participants need access to funds after network ends. This will be facilitated both 
    - (a) the chain will run past the configured `market_trading_terminated` until `chain_end_of_life_date` so that people have time to withdraw; and 
    - (b) using restoration of balances to allow participants to withdraw or continue to trade with funds during the next iteration of the chain.
- A governance proposal to change `markets_freeze_date` and `chain_end_of_life_date` must check that `chain_end_of_life_date > markets_freeze_date`.

1. Other party `i` delegates all its tokens to `validator_party_j` with `j = i mod 5` (i.e. the remainder after integer division of `j` by `i`.). For example if `N=20000` then party `i=15123` will delegate all its `15123` tokens to validator `validator_party_3` since `15123 mod 5 = 3`.   
1. The `Staking and delegation` rewards are active so that every hour each party that has delegated tokens receives `0.01` of the delegated amount as a reward.
1. The network runs for 5 hours. 
1. Each of the `other_party_i` has Vega token general account balance equal to `5 x 0.01 x i`. Note that these are separate from the tokens locked on the staking Ethereum bridge.

1. The network is shut down. 
1. Validator `1` has freed `500` tokens from the Vega Ethereum staking contract.
1. The network is restarted with the same `5` validators and checkpoint hash from the above checkpoint in genesis. The checkpoint replay transaction is submitted and processed.
1. There is a Vega token asset. 
1. Validator parties `validator_party_2`,...,`validator_party_5` has `1000` Vega tokens locked on the staking Ethereum bridge and this is reflected in Vega core.
1. Validator party `validator_party_1` has `500` Vega tokens locked on the staking Ethereum bridge and this is reflected in Vega core.
1. There are `N` other parties and the delegation info in core says that other party `i` has delegated all its tokens to `validator_party_j` with `j = i mod 5`.
1. Each of the `other_party_i` has Vega token general account balance equal to `5 x 0.01 x i`. Note that these are separate from the tokens locked on the staking Ethereum bridge.
1. Each of the `other_party_i` has Vega token general account balance equal to `5 x 0.01 x i`. Note that these are separate from the tokens locked on the staking Ethereum bridge.
