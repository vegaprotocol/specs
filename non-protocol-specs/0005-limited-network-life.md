# Limited network life.

Vega networks will at least initially and perhaps always run for a limited time only. This spec covers the necessary features to ensure this works smoothly.

# Background

Networks will have a finite lifetime because:

- It is efficient to upgrade the protocol by starting again as it avoids the need to deal with multiple versions of the code (upgrades to a running chain need to respect and be able to recalculate the pre-upgrade deterministic state for earlier blocks, so all versions of critical code must remain in the system).
This is especially important early on when rapid iteration is desirable, as the assumption that new chains can be started for new features simplifies things considerably.

- Trading at 1000s of tx/sec generates a lot of data. Given that most instruments are non-perpetual (they expire), this gives the ability to create new markets on a new chain and naturally let the old one come to an end rather than dragging around its history forever.

- Bugs, security breaches, or other issues during alpha could either take out the chain OR make it desirable to halt block production. It's important to consider what happens next if this occurs.

# Overview
There are four main features:
1. Create checkpoints with relevant (but minimal) information at regular intervals, and on every deposit and every withdrawal request.
2. Ability to specify a checkpoint hash as part of genesis.
3. A new 'Restore' transaction that contains the full checkpoint file and triggers state restoration
4. A new 'checkpoint hash' transaction is broadcast by all validators

Point two requires that at load time, each node calculates the hash of the checkpoint file. It then sends this through consensus to make sure that all the nodes in the new network agree on the state. 


# Creating a checkpoint
Information to store:
- All [network parameters](../protocol/0054-NETP-network_parameters.md), including those defined [below](#network-parameters).
- All [asset definitions](../protocol/0040-ASSF-asset_framework.md#asset-definition). Insurance pool balance from the markets will be summed up per asset and balance per asset stored.
- All market proposals ([creation](../protocol/0028-GOVE-governance.md#1-create-market) and [update](../protocol/0028-GOVE-governance.md#2-change-market-parameters)) that have been *accepted*.
- All [asset proposals](../protocol/0028-GOVE-governance.md) that have been *accepted*.
- All delegation info.
- On chain treasury balances and on-chain reward functions / parameters (for ðŸ’§ Sweetwater this is only the staking and delegation reward account balance and network params that govern [Staking and delegation](../protocol/0057-REWF-reward_functions.md) ).
- All reward balances accrued by all parties but not yet transferred to their general account due to payout delays.
- [Account balances](../protocol/0013-ACCT-accounts.md) for all parties per asset: sum of general, margin and LP bond accounts. See exception below about signed-for-withdrawal. Does *not* include the "staking" account balance.
- Fee pools: Fees are paid into per market or per asset pools and distributed periodically. 
- Event ID of the last processed deposit event for all bridged chains
- Withdrawal transaction bundles for all bridged chains for all ongoing withdrawals (parties with non-zero "signed-for-withdrawal" balances)
- hash of the previous block, block number and transaction id of the block from which the snapshot is derived
When a checkpoint is created, each validator should calculate its hash and submit this as a transaction to the chain(*).
- last block height and hash and event ID of all bridged chains (e.g. Ethereum) that the core has seen `number_of_confirmations` of the event.

When to create a checkpoint:
- if `current_time - network.checkpoint.timeElapsedBetweenCheckpoints > time_of_last_full_checkpoint`
- if there was withdrawal
Withdrawal checkpoint can be just a delta containing the balance change + hash of previous checkpoint (either delta or full).

Information we explicitly don't try to checkpoint:
- Positions, limit orders, pegged orders or any order book data.
- Balances in the "signed for withdrawal" account.
- Market and asset proposals where the voting period hasn't ended.

When a checkpoint is created, each validator should calculate its hash and submit this is a transaction to the chain, so that non-validating parties can trust the hash being restored represents truly the balances.

The checkpoint file should either be human-readable OR there should be a command line tool to convert into human readable form.

# Specifying the checkpoint hash in genesis

# Restoring a checkpoint
The hash of the state file to be restored must be specified in genesis.
Any validator will submit a transaction containing the checkpoint file. Nodes verify the hash / chain of hashes to verify the hash that is in genesis.
- If the hash matches, it will be restored.
- If it does not, the hash transaction will have no effect.

If the genesis file has a previous state hash, all transactions will be rejected until the restore transaction arrives and is processed.

The state will be restored in this order:

1. Restore network parameters.
2. Load the asset definitions.
    1. The network will compare the asset coming from the restore file with the genesis assets, one by one. If there is an exact match on asset id:
      -  either the rest of the asset definition matches exactly in which case move to next asset coming from restore file.
      -  or any of the part of the definition differ, in which case ignore the entire restore transaction, the node should stop with an error.
    2. If the asset coming from the restore file is a new asset (asset id not matching any genesis assets) then restore the asset.
3. Load the accepted market proposals.
    - If the enactment date is in the past then set the enactment date to `now + net_param_min_enact` (so that opening auction can take place) and status to pending.
    - In case `now + net_param_min_enact >= trading_terminated` set the status to cancelled.
4. Replay events from bridged chains
   - Concerning bridges used to deposit collateral for trading, replay from the last event id stored in the checkpoint.
   - Concerning the staking bridges, the balances are not stored in the checkpoints, only delegations to validators is kept track of.
	 When being restarted, the node will load all events emitted by the staking bridges (from the creation of the staking bridge contracts),
	 and reconcile the accounts balances, then apply again the delegations to the validators.

There should be a tool to extract all assets from the restore file so that they can be added to genesis block manually, should the validators so desire.

# Taking limited network life into account
- Participants need access to funds after network ends. This will be facilitated both
    - (a) the chain will run past the configured `market_trading_terminated` until `chain_end_of_life_date` so that people have time to withdraw; and
    - (b) using restoration of balances to allow participants to withdraw or continue to trade with funds during the next iteration of the chain.
- A governance proposal to change `markets_freeze_date` and `chain_end_of_life_date` must check that `chain_end_of_life_date > markets_freeze_date`.

# Network parameters
| Name                                                     | Type     | Description                                                       | Version added  |
|----------------------------------------------------------|:--------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:|
|`network.checkpoint.marketFreezeDate` | String (date)| Sets the date before which all markets are expected to settle and after which no deposits or trading / governance transactions will be accepted. This can be +infinity or another way of indicating "never". | ðŸ’§ Sweetwater |
|`network.checkpoint.networkEndOfLifeDate`| String (date) | This must be `>` `markets_freeze_date`. At this time the chain will be shutdown.  |  ðŸ’§ Sweetwater |
|`network.checkpoint.timeElapsedBetweenCheckpoints` | String (duration) |  sets the minimum time elapsed between checkpoints|  ðŸ’§ Sweetwater |

If for `network.checkpoint.timeElapsedBetweenCheckpoints` the value is set to `0` or the parameter is undefined then no checkpoints are created. Otherwise any time-length value `>0` is valid e.g. `1min`, `2h30min10s`, `1month`. If the value is invalid Vega should not start e.g. if set to `3 fish`.

1. Enough time passes after the 5 hour period so that a checkpoint is created and no party submitted any withdrawal transactions throughout.
1. The network is shut down.
1. Validator `1` has freed `500` tokens from the Vega Ethereum staking contract.
1. The network is restarted with the same `5` validators and checkpoint hash from the above checkpoint in genesis. The checkpoint restore transaction is submitted and processed.
1. There is a Vega token asset.
1. Validator parties `validator_party_2`,...,`validator_party_5` has `1000` Vega tokens locked on the staking Ethereum bridge and this is reflected in Vega core.

1. There are `N` other parties and the delegation info in core says that other party `i` has delegated all its tokens to `validator_party_j` with `j = i mod 5`.
1. Each of the `other_party_i` has Vega token general account balance equal to `5 x 0.01 x i`. Note that these are separate from the tokens locked on the staking Ethereum bridge.
1. Each of the `other_party_i` has Vega token general account balance equal to `5 x 0.01 x i`. Note that these are separate from the tokens locked on the staking Ethereum bridge.
