Summary

This specification contains a set of tests/acceptance criteria that clients (wallets/bots) interacting with Vega are advised to test against
to assure that they can authenticate properly, pass spam protection, process notifications, etc. 

The parameter 'spam.pow.numberofTxPerBlock' is decrerased.  Verify that o
        - The new parameter is communicated to and adapted by the wallet, i.e., if a user has too many 
          transactions according to the new parameter, the wallet does not submit transactions with a too low
          PoW difficulty (either by submitting a PoW of higher difficulty, or by submitting the transactions later).

- The parameter 'spam.pow.numberofTxPerBlock' is increased. Verify that
     - This is communicated to the wallet, and the wallet uses the new parameter for each transaction tied to a block with a height higher than the one in which the change happened. This means that a wallet
 that had has a number of transactions exceeding the previous limit, but not the current one, does not increase the PoW difficulty or delay the transactions.

The parameter 'spam.pow.difficulty' is increased.  Verify that
    - This is communicated to all the wallet, and the wallet uses the new parameter for each transaction 
      tied to a block with a height higher than the one in which the change happened.

- The parameter 'spam.pow.difficulty' is decreased. Verify that
     - This is communicated to the wallet, and the wallet use thes new parameter for each transaction 
        tied to a block with a height higher than the one in which the change happened.
  (<a name="1011-SPAM-004" href="#1011-SPAM-004">1011-SPAM-004</a>)  
    
   - The parameter 'spam.pow.increaseDifficulty' is changed from 0 to 1.  Verify that
     - This is communicated to the wallet, and wallet uses the new parameter for each transaction tied to a block with a height higher than the one in which the change happened. 
       This requires the wallet to be subjected to a difficulty increase due to too many messages
(<a name="1011-SPAM-005" href="#1011-SPAM-005">1011-SPAM-005</a>)  

  - The parameter 'spam.pow.increaseDifficulty' is changed from 1 to 0.  Verify that
     - This is communicated to the wallet, and wallet uses the new parameter for each transaction tied to a block with a height higher than the one in which the change happened. 
       This requires the wallet to be subjected to a difficulty increase due to too many messages
