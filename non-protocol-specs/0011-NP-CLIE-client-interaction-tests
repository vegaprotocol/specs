Summary

This specification contains a set of tests that clients (wallets/bots) interacting with Vega are advised to test against
to assure that they can authenticate properly, pass spam protection, process notifications, etc. 

The parameter 'spam.pow.numberofTxPerBlock' is decrerased.  Verify that o
        - The new parameter is communicated to and adapted by the wallets, i.e., if a user has too many 
          transactions according to the new parameter, the wallet does not submit transactions with a too low
          PoW difficulty (either by submitting a PoW of higher difficulty, or by submitting the transactions later).
        - The new parameter addapted for all blocks with a block height higher than the current one, i.e., a number of transactions 
          that was allowed before and is no longer due to the new parameter is rejected (leaving the spam difficulty level constant)
          
The parameter 'spam.pow.difficulty' is increased.  Verify that
    - This is communicated to all wallets, and wallets use the new parameter for each transaction tied to a block with a height higher than the one in which the change happened.

- The parameter 'spam.pow.difficulty' is decreased. Verify that
     - This is communicated to all wallets, and wallets use the new parameter for each transaction tied to a block with a height higher than the one in which the change happened.
