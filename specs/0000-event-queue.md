Feature name: Event Queue

Start date: 2020-04-09

Specification PR: https://github.com/vegaprotocol/product/pull/271


# Summary
Latency and throughput is of paramount importance to Vega validator nodes, so monitoring various 3rd party (and notably low transaction speed) blockchains and crypto-assets isnâ€™t possible.
To counter this problem we have created an event queue management system.
This event queue allows the standardization and propagation of transactions from 3rd party asset chains into the Vega event message format.

# Guide-level explanation
Events and transactions are gathered and processed by the Event Queue from a given 3rd party blockchain, and only the ones subscribed to by Vega nodes will be propagated through consensus and then validated by the validator nodes.
This makes the event queue works as a buffer between the slow/complicated world of various blockchains, and the high throughput, low latency of Vega Core.
This message queue will use gRPC to communicate with the Vega network via 3 main functions: `Get_Subscribed_Event_Sources`, `Propagate_Event`, and `Event_Acceptance_Status`.
The first, `Get_Subscribed_Event_Sources`, returns a list of smart contract addresses and events that consensus has deemed as a valid source.
The second function, `Propagate_Event`, allows an event queue to send events raised on 3rd party blockchains (deposits, withdrawals, etc) through Vega consensus to ensure an event has been seen by the network. This function must support multiple blockchains as sources of events and multiple sources on a single blockchain (such as multiple deployments of an ERC20 bridge).
Each validator will individually process and validate the given transaction and only parse for the specified event reported.
The last function, `Event_Acceptance_Status`, returns the consensus acceptance status of a requested event. The event queue uses this function to determine if it should attempt to send the event again.

# Reference-level explanation
* The event queue calls `Get_Subscribed_Event_Sources` on a Vega node to get the list of subscribed smart contracts
* The event queue gets events from provided smart contract addresses via an Ethereum node
* Event queue filters for specific events it cares about (see `Event_Types`)
* For each event it calls `Event_Acceptance_Status` on a Vega node
* Event queue then creates an `Event_Propagation_Request` for each applicable event that has yet to be accepted and submits them to `Propagate_Event` on a Vega validator node
* Vega validators each verify each event against a local (or trusted hosted(?)) Ethereum node
* Consensus agrees and writes event into the Vega chain

# Pseudo-code / Examples

The protobuf of the service:
```proto
service event_queue_receiver {
  rpc Get_Subscribed_Event_Sources() returns (Get_Subscribed_Event_Sources_Response);
  rpc Propagate_Event(Event_Propagation_Request) returns (Event_Propagation_Response);
  rpc Event_Acceptance_Status(Event_Acceptance_Status_Request) returns (Event_Acceptance_Status_Response);
}

message Get_Subscribed_Event_Sources_Response {
  repeated string subscirbed_event_source=1;
}

//this will expand with the system
enum Event_Types {
  EVENT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  Asset_Deposited = 1;
  Asset_Withdrawn = 2;
  Asset_Listed = 3;
  Asset_Delisted = 4;
  Deposit_Minimum_Set = 5;
}

message Event_Propagation_Request {
  string event_source = 1; // address of bridge
  string asset_source = 2; // address of asset
  string asset_id = 3; // ID of asset specific to that asset_source
  Event_Types event_type = 4; // enumerated event type
  string transaction_hash = 7; // tx hash in question that must lead us to parseable data based on 'event_type'
  uint32 log_index = 8; // if the transaction outputs multiple events to the log, this tells you which one
  string event_name = 9; // friendly name of event specific to bridge/source
  uint32 block_number = 10; // block number of source chain the event occurred
}

message Event_Propagation_Response {
  bool success = 1; // indicate if the request was valid
}

message Event_Acceptance_Status_Request {
  string transaction_hash = 1;
  uint32 log_index = 2;
}

//can be expanded as needed
enum Event_Acceptance_Status {
  Unknown = 0;
  Accepted = 1;
  Rejected = 2;
}
message Event_Acceptance_Status_Response {
  string transaction_hash = 1;
  uint32 log_index = 2;
  Event_Acceptance_Status acceptance_status = 3;
}
```

# Acceptance Criteria
## Event Queue
* Event Queue calls `Get_Subscribed_Event_Sources` and successfully parses the response
* Event Queue gathers and filters applicable events from Ethereum node
* Event Queue calls `Event_Acceptance_Status` and marks accepted events internally as complete
* Event Queue propagates unaccepted events to Vega node via `Propagate_Event`

## Vega Nodes
* Vega nodes respond to `Get_Subscribed_Event_Sources` with a list of valid smart contract events
* Vega nodes accept events submitted to `Propagate_Event` and verifies them against valid Ethereum node
* Vega nodes write events to chain once verified
* Vega nodes respond appropriately to `Event_Acceptance_Status`
* Vega nodes verify Event existance and outcomes using local Ethereum node
** Verify balance changes
** Verify account identities
** Verify transaction hashes
* Vega nodes reject invalid events that fail verification in the previous step
