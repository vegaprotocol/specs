# Summary

Accounts are used on Vega to maintain a record of the amount of collateral that is deposited and deployed by participants in the market.


# Reference-level explanation

Various actions that occur in the protocol will prompt the creation and/or deletion of accounts. Double entry accounting is maintained at all points.

All accounts must:

- have an initial value of zero for whichever asset it maintains

- only change balance as a response to a valid transfer request that adheres to double entry accounting standards.

- only be created and deleted by transfer requests. Deletion account transfer requests must specify which account should receive any outstanding funds in the account that's being deleted.

## Accounts for  assets

**Creation:**

The first time an entity deposits an asset into Vega's collateral smart contract, an asset account is created for that party on Vega and credited with the equivalent amount. 

This account:

* is where the trading profits for all markets that have settlement in that asset will be eventually distributed back to (this occurs when the protocol releases collateral from a margin account)
* is where the protocol searches for collateral if the trader has entered a collateral search zone. 
* is used by all Vega markets with that settlement asset.
* will have it's balance increased or decreased when a party deposits or withdraws that asset from Vega.

**Deletion:**

The core protocol does not require these general asset accounts if they have a balance of zero. 

## Margin accounts

Margin accounts are used by the protocol to maintain [margin requirements](./0010-risk-and-margin-orchestration) and collect and distribute [mark to market settlement](./0002-settlement). Each party only needs a margin account created for a market they've ever put an order on.

Moreover, margin accounts are conceptually connected to open positions and given there no such thing as a zero open position a margin account may therefore be transient (i.e. there would be no such thing as a margin account that has a balance of zero).


**Creation:**

When a trader places an order on a market and they do not have a margin account for that market, a margin accounts is created for the trader for each settlement asset of that market. This may be due to either:
* it's the first time a trader has placed an order or;
* they've previously had a margin account but it was deleted for the reason listed below.

**Deletion:**

When a trader no longer has collateral requirements for a  market (because they don't have open positions or active orders), these accounts no longer have utility in the core protocol and may be deleted. Accounts may also be deleted for other reasons (e.g. a system account at the conclusion of a set of [closeouts](./0012-position-resolution)).

If there is a positive balance in an account that is being deleted, that balance should be transferred to the account specified in the transfer request (which for margin accounts will typically be the insurance pool of the market).

## Insurance pools

Every market will have at least one insurance pool account that holds collateral that can be used to cover losses in case of unreasonable market events.

**Creation:**

When a market launches, an insurance pool account is created for that market for each settlement asset. This account is used by the protocol during the collection of [margin requirements](./0010-risk-and-margin-orchestration) and the collection of [mark to market settlement](./0002-settlement. 

**Deletion:**

When a market is finalised / closed remaining funds are distributed to other same-currency insurance pools as per white paper section 6.4.  This occurs using ledger entries to preserve double entry accounting records within the collateral engine.
