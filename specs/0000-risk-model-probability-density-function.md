## Acceptance Critieria

1. [ ] Given an input mid-price $`m`$, a timestep $`\tau > 0`$ and a vector of non-overlapping price intervals $`\mathbf{v}`$ the risk model returns a vector of probabilities $`\mathbf{p}`$.
2. [ ] The risk model doesn't assume that the provided price intervals fully cover all the possible future states (i.e. the probabilities need not sum to 1).
3. [ ] Take a fixed vector $`\mathbf{v^1}`$ of length $`n`$ of price intervals as an input, create another vector $`\mathbf{v^2}`$ by copying $`\mathbf{v^1}`$ and adding another dimension $`v^2_{n+1}`$, given same mid price $`m`$ and timestep $`\tau`$, the vectors $`\mathbf{p^1}`$ and $`\mathbf{p^2}`$ (corresponding to inputs $`\mathbf{v^1}`$ and $`\mathbf{v^2}`$) returned by the risk model should have the first $`n`$ entries equal.

## Summary

When measuring liquidity we will need to take a view on what might be the distribution of the mid-price at a given point in time in the future. This is exactly what the risk model does internally, hence we will want to expose that functionality so it can be accessed as needed.

## Guide-level explanation

We will use a risk model specified for a given market along with the following parameters:

* $`\tau > 0`$ - the desired timestep for the future distribution of prices,
* $`m > 0`$ - the current mid-price,
* $`\mathbf{v}`$ - a vector of non-overlapping price intervals for which we want the probabilities go get estimated by the model.

We expect the following output:

* $`\mathbf{p}`$ - a vector of probabilities corresponding to the input price intervals from $`\mathbf{v}`$.

## Pseudo-code / Examples

To be provided later.

## TODO

* Add a percentile function. 
* Add formulas for pdfs for the risk models we've got (in the appropriate step).
