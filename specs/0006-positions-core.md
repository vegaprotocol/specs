# Summary

Vega needs to keep track of positions for two purposes:

- The **Position Engine** needs to keep basic position data for each trader in each market where they have a *non-zero net open position*:
	- Position size (net volume: positive for long positions, negative for short positions)
	- “Potential position size”: **TODO: WIP logic for additional potential position from orders**

- The **Positions API**, for all practical purpose (to achieve reasonable performance) needs to maintain records of both open and closed positions for all traders, including:
	- Position size (net volume: positive for long positions, negative for short positions)
	- Volume weighted average entry price see [average price](https://gitlab.com/vega-protocol/product/wikis/Trading-and-Protocol-Glossary#average-entry-price)
	- Volume weighted average closing price (for closed positions)
	- Valuation / P&L (a.k.a. unrealised P&L for open positions, realised P&L for closed)

Both components work by processing each Trade occurring in Vega in order, as they occur, and updating the required position record. As long as the right data is stored, this can be done in both cases without re-iterating over prior trades when ingesting a new trade.


## Position Engine

### Functionality

The Position Engine processes each trade in the following way:

1. If the buyer and seller are the same (wash trade), do nothing.

1. For each of the buyer and seller, look for a position record for the current market. If either record is not found, create it.

1. Update the position size for each record:
	- BuyerPosition.size += Trade.size
	- SellerPosition.size -= Trade.size

1. If either position record has Position.size == 0, delete it, otherwise save the updated record.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Maintains correct position size for all non-zero open positions
- [ ] Maintains separate position data for each market a trader is active in
- [ ] Updates correctly when increasing or decreasing the absolute position size for both long or short positions
- [ ] Correctly handles positions that switch from long to short and vice versatility
- [ ] Does not store data for positions that are reduced to size == 0
- [ ] Correctly sets position size when a trader who has previously had a position then closed it fully (reduced size to 0) proceeds to trade again
- [ ] Does not change position size for a wash trade
