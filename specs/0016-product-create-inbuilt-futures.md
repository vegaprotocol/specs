Start date: 2019-10-24
Specification PR: https://gitlab.com/vega-protocol/product/merge_requests

# Acceptance Criteria
Check list of statements that need to met for the feature to be considered correctly implemented.

# Summary
Specification of a "Future" type instrument that fits in with https://vega.xyz/papers/vega-protocol-whitepaper.pdf Section 3.3. The textbook definition of a future is that it binds you to buy a given underlying asset (underlying) at an agreed future date (settlement) for an agreed price in some agreed currency. 

# Guide-level explanation
Explain the specification as if it was already included and you are explaining it to another developer working on Vega. This generally means:
- Introducing new named concepts
- Explaining the features, providing some simple high level examples
- If applicable, provide migration guidance

# Reference-level explanation
This is the main portion of the specification. Break it up as required.

# Pseudo-code / Examples
If you have some data types, or sample code to show interactions, put it here

# Test cases
Some plain text walkthroughs of some scenarios that would prove that the implementation correctly follows this specification.
