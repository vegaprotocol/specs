# Summary
In a centralised service, identity is a set of personal details, including an ID
(username or email address) and password. Authentication is achieved by
re-submitting the ID and password. So far, so centralised.

In a decentralised service, identity boils down to "ownership of cryptographic
keys" and authentication boils down to "proof of ownership of cryptographic
keys".
