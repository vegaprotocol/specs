    "# Quantitative risk models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acceptance Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [ ] Different markets can have a different risk model (i.e. a market A can be specified to run with risk model R1 while market B can be specified to run with risk model R2).  .\n",
    "1. [ ] The risk factors are recalculated only when the inputs have changed since the last call.\n",
    "1. [ ] If any of the input data has changed then an update to risk factors is initiated. \n",
    "1. [ ] Risk factors are agreed upon by consensus. \n",
    "1. [ ] If the risk factor calculation reports \"guaranteed accuracy\" then the risk factors are appropriately rounded. \n",
    "1. [ ] If an async update to risk factors is already running, don't start a new one until the previous one has finished. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "The quant risk suite contains functionality to deliver:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Risk factors (calculated by  the _quantitative risk model_)\n",
    "1. Given a probability level $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, time horizon $\\tau > 0$ and current price $S$ return the $\\Delta^-$ and $\\Delta^+$ such that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb P(S-\\Delta^- \\leq S_\\tau \\leq S+\\Delta^+) \\geq 1-\\alpha\\,.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1. Given current price $S$, time horizon $\\tau > 0$, a list of price levels $S < S_1 < S_2 < \\cdots < S_N^+$ return the probability of trading at each of these price levels defined below. \n",
    "1. Calibration outputs (not required for first release of Mainnet, model parameters result from governance vote per market)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The “quant risk suite” encapsulates a _quantitative risk model_, _margin calculator_ and _calibrator_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The market parameter specifies which _quantitative risk model_ is in play for a market.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reference-level explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Quantitative risk model_\n",
    "The relevant quantitative risk model for a market is specified on a tradeable instrument. The role of the quantitative risk model is to calculate **risk factors** which are used in the **_margin calculator_** (see below)\n",
    "as well as probabilities of various price moves used for price monitoring and measuring liquidity. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this it utilises the quantitative maths library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantitative risk model may take one or more of the following as inputs:\n",
    "* risk parameters (e.g. volatility)\n",
    "* product parameters (e.g. minimum contract size)\n",
    "* order book data (full current order book with volume aggregated at price levels)\n",
    "* position data (for each trader)\n",
    "* event data (e.g. passage of time) (Not for Futures / Nicenet )\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantitative risk model returns two risk factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rounded Long position risk factor\n",
    "1. Rounded Short position risk factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantitative risk model is able to utilise a relevant method from the quant math library to perform the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quant math library calculates:\n",
    "1. Long position risk factor\n",
    "1. Short position risk factor\n",
    "1. Guaranteed accuracy (applicable to both risk factors)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the probability of trading\n",
    "\n",
    "Given current price $S$, time horizon $\\tau > 0$, a list of price levels $S < S_1 < S_2 < \\cdots < S_{N^+}$ return the probability of trading at each of these price levels defined below. \n",
    "Given a list of price levels $S > S_1 > S_2 > \\cdots > S_{N^-}$ return the probability of trading at each of these defined below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quant risk model has the probability density of price distribution at time horizon $\\tau > 0$ i.e. let \n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\mathbb P(S_\\tau \\in [x, x+dx) | S)\\,. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For given maximum and minimum prices $S_{max}$ and $S_{min}$ we can then calculate the probability of trading for any $S_i > S$ as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(S_i) = \\int_{S_i}^{S_{max}} f(x)\\,dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and for any $S_i < S$ calculate\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(S_i) = \\int_{S_{min}}^{S_i} f(x)\\,dx\\,.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Return $p(S_i)$ for each $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to not update risk factors\n",
    "\n",
    "The call to the quantitative math library should *only* be made if any of the above inputs have changed from last time; if no input has changed then the quantitative risk model doesn't need to update the risk factors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to update risk factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk factors are an input to the [margin calculation](./0019-margin-calculator.md) and are calculated using a [quantitative risk model](./0018-quant-risk-suite.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk factors are updated if  \n",
    "* An update risk factors call is not already in progress asynchronously; AND\n",
    "* Any of the required inputs to risk factors change. Examples 1. when the calibrator has updated any risk parameters. 2. a specified period of time has elapsed (period can = 0 for always recalculate) for re-calculating risk factors. This period of time is defined as a risk parameter (see [market framework](./0001-market-framework.md)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk factors are also updated if on creation of a new market that does not yet have risk factors, as any active market needs to have risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risk factors and consensus\n",
    "\n",
    "All new risk factors will need to be agreed via consensus when either (or both): \n",
    "- asynchronous updates\n",
    "- the other cause will be due to floating point non-determinism\n",
    "\n",
    "The rounding should remove all digits beyond the guaranteed accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If `Long position risk factor = 1.23456789` and `Guaranteed accuracy = 0.001` then \n",
    "`Rounded Long position risk factor = 1.234`. \n",
    "\n",
